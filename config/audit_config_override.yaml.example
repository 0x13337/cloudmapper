# # Example 2: Ignore certain resources from the auditing
# S3_PUBLIC_POLICY_GETOBJECT_ONLY:
#   # This is an array of regexes, and must match the entire string
#   # These string match against the resource IDs, which in the `audit --json` output 
#   # is the "resource" element. In the report, it is the value listed after the 
#   # account and region, such as a user name, EC2 instance ID, S3 bucket name, etc.
